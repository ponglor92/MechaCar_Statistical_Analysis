## Linear Regression To Predict MPG

![output from linear regression](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101531875/183807873-a724e00f-9348-402f-be4d-80344da4c905.png)

- The variables that provided non- random amount of variance to mpg were vehicle length and ground clearance. Both of their p- values are extremely small meaning that they had high level of significance.
- No, it is not to be considered zero, because the linear regression shows how some independent variables are affceted by the dependent variables. 
- Because we are going by the R-dquared value, the percentage is 71% because according to the output from the linear regression, the r-squared value is 0.7149, meaning the effectiveness is 71% out of 100%. Therefore, the model would be considered effective.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Below are the two dataframes: "total summary and lot summary" I createdm for suspension coil PSI's.The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The current manufacturing data does meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total. However, individually, only lots 1 and 2 meet the specification. Both lot 1 and 2 had a variance of 0.97 and 7.46, but lot 2 has a variance of 170.28, exceeding the 100 pound per square inch specification.
