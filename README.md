## Linear Regression To Predict MPG

![output from linear regression](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101531875/183807873-a724e00f-9348-402f-be4d-80344da4c905.png)

- The variables that provided non- random amount of variance to mpg were vehicle length and ground clearance. Both of their p- values are extremely small meaning that they had high level of significance.
- No, it is not to be considered zero, because the linear regression shows how some independent variables are affceted by the dependent variables. 
- Because we are going by the R-dquared value, the percentage is 71% because according to the output from the linear regression, the r-squared value is 0.7149, meaning the effectiveness is 71% out of 100%. Therefore, the model would be considered effective.
